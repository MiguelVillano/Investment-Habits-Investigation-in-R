# Investment Preference Pattern Regression
This project analyzes how investment preferences differ between younger adults (21–28) and older adults (29–35) using regression modeling and exploratory data analysis.

## Overview
Survey data containing preference rankings for various investment avenues were cleaned, rescaled, and used to predict age group based on investment behavior.

## Methods
- Data cleaning & transformation  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Multiple regression modeling  
- Model refinement & evaluation
- Final Model interpretation  

## Key Findings
- Older adults prefer safer investments (Fixed Deposits, Government Bonds).  
- Younger adults prefer riskier investments (Mutual Funds, Equity Market, Debentures).  

## Tools
R, MASS, corrplot, lmtest

## Files
